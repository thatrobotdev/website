I was a bit confused with the connection, but <a href=\"https://scottishwildlifetrust.org.uk/2020/09/why-do-we-call-them-skeins-of-geese/\">the Scottish Wildlife Trust says</a>, “[w]ith their very efficient, orderly lines, they can kind of look like a long piece of wool gliding through the sky, rippling as the geese change positions.” Who knows, though, because they even concede it's a “bit of an etymological mystery.”</p>\n<p>I also adore how the edition of the book I was reading typeset the flock's formation as a tiny <strong>v</strong>.</p>\n<figure>\n\t<img alt=\"A scan of The Snow Goose, on page \" src=\"https://www.jameskerrane.com/blog/bird-tidbits/tiny-v.png\">\n\t<figcaption>(Gallico 24)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"primaries\" tabindex=\"-1\">primaries <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.jameskerrane.com/blog/bird-tidbits/#primaries\">#</a></h2>\n<figure>\n\t<img alt=\"Bird wing bone structure, indicating attachment points of remiges.\" src=\"https://www.jameskerrane.com/blog/bird-tidbits/Birdwing.svg\">\n\t<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Birdwing.svg\">L.

However, it seems pretty common to pinion a bird, and it looks like they might grow back?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“See, we will clip her <strong>primaries</strong> so that we can bandage it, but in the spring the feathers will grow and she will be able to fly again” (Gallico 19; emphasis added).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These pinions are the outermost primaries, which are flight feathers that allow a bird to take flight!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Those are all for now, but it was such a great read!
