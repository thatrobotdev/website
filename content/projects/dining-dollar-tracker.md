title: Dining Dollar Tracker

## Status

Not started

## End Goal

I want to learn how to build an iOS app to track dining dollar purchases.

## Preliminary Research

In preliminary research on how to approach the problem, I found this [awesome write-up](https://gist.github.com/rkevin-arch/77fc4949ae5ccd407c372251ddcfb279?permalink_comment_id=5085588) by [rkevin-arch](https://gist.github.com/rkevin-arch) which goes through their approach to the problem and possible algorithms. They approach the light puzzle with intuitive human logic, a [minimax solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax), and a [max entropy solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) based on a [3blue1brown video on information theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA). Since I am unfamiliar with information theory and these types of problems, it's time to learn!

While I have looked to these previous resources as inspiration to guide my research, I do not want to heavily rely on them as the basis for my solution. They have provided a jumping point for where to start, and I will only compare my solution with other solutions once I have approached the problem from my perspective.
